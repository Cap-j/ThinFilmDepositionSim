# Simulating Plasma-Enhanced Thin Film Deposition

This simulation was written as the final project in my B.Eng. in Electronic and Computer Engineering (major in Systems and Devices).

The program simulates the plasma-enhanced physical vapour deposition process, which is a technique sued in microelectronics fabrication. It implements the use of the OpenGL API and the freeGlut library (available at http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) in order to visualise the process.

Although the project was already submitted, I am continuously working on improving and expanding it as I found it to be both an efficient way to teach myself software development, and a very fun experience. Some of the things I'm currently working on are:
- UI implementation
- Improving the movement of target atoms and implementing elastic collisions for a more accurate simulation.
- Adding more variables, such as atom and plasma species.
